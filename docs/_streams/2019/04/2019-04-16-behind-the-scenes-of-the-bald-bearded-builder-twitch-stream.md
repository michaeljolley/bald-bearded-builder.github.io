## Things we learned

- Adding `"files.defaultLanguage": "markdown"` in the `.vscode/settings.json` will default new files to save as markdown
- `shift-win-s` key combination in Windows 10 brings up a great screen snipping tool and will copy image to the clipboard
- Bluetooth keyboards/mice are not always our friend

## Notes

- Need to look into getting wired devices for streaming.  Losing connection on the Bluetooth keyboard/mouse really derailed the stream today

## Goals

- [x] Make progress on checklists & scripts

## Next Steps

- Complete all stream checklists
- Complete all stream scripts
- Ensure https://baldbeardedbuilder.com site is generating correctly
