### Today's Candle To Code By

## Things we learned

- [@ElectricHavoc]() shared a link for a fancy shell to use when playing with WSL: [https://cmder.net/](https://cmder.net/)
- [@ksivamuthu](https://github.com/ksivamuthu) shared his [Peacock Twitch Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ksivamuthu.vscode-peacock-twitch-client)

## Notes

- [@cmjchrisjones](https://github.com/cmjchrisjones) was being picky about the bug in our bot when using the csharpHype before csharpHypebot.  (He's like that you know.)
- The mic is clicking/popping
- There's a bug in the bot that makes it go bye-bye.

## Goals

- [x] Steal @clarkio's code and modify commands for new extension
- [ ] Return list of available themes
- [ ] Change theme via !theme {name}

## Next Steps

- Need to get the extension changing the theme on command & returning a whisper with available themes
