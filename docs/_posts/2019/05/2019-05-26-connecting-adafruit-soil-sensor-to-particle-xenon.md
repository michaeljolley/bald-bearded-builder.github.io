### Today's Candle To Code By

[Old Factory Mahogany](https://amzn.to/2IHHPNJ)

## Things we learned

- [majorthorn](https://github.com/majorthorn) Suggested the following future baby bird names for Aviary:
    - Big Momma & Dinky (Fox & the Hound)
    - Archimedes (Sword and the Stone)
- [majorthorn](https://github.com/majorthorn) helped us name our mesh network Volary after we couldn't join/delete the existing Aviary mesh network
- [cmjchrisjones](https://github.com/cmjchrisjones)  https://github.com/cmjchrisjones/LiveCodersStreamDeckProfilesTwitchCommands/
- The [Particle](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/device-os/led/argon/) documentation provides definitions to various blinking
patterns of the device LED
- Based on the [Particle community forums](https://community.particle.io/t/unable-to-setup-argon-on-mesh-network/46463/4) we learned
that you can not currently delete a mesh network from your account
- Someone shared the [Waveshare 7in HDMI touch screen display](https://amzn.to/2M8pooA) for possible use in our project to
notify the family of streaming/on call/available system


## Things to Review & Notes

- [Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina) will be joining us next Sunday, June 2nd, as we
continue our [Heroines of Javascript](https://www.twitch.tv/themichaeljolley/events) series
- IO is being delivered Tuesday
- [varlabel](https://twitch.tv/varlabel) suggested monitoring flow to our planters via volume rather than
sensing moisture level to stop watering.  `water density / volume * pore space`

## Goals

- [x] Review pull requests on our VS Code extension
- [x] Connect our soil moisture sensor to our Xenon and start sending actual measurements to mother bird

## Ideas / Next Steps

- [roberttables](https://github.com/mtheoryx) suggested adding a `!heroines` command to link people to more information
about our upcoming Heroines of Javascript series.
- We want to submit feedback to [Particle](https://particle.io) that the Workbench extension should report when
flashing is complete.  Currently it says "Flashing device_name..." but never sends a message when the flashing has finished.
